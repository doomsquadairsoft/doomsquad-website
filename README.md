## Doom Squad Airsoft

Doom Squad airsoft is a Live Action Role Playing (LARP) airsoft clan where we dress up like soldiers, run around in the woods and shoot each other with plastic BBs in fast paced, semi-competitive war gaming. We often take ideas from video games such as Counter-Strike, Battlefield, Call of Duty, and apply them to custom airsoft games. Our games often incorporate pyrotechnics, realistic props, and special airsoft weapons. We are kids in adult bodies, and we love this action pursuit sport. We are always looking to have more people come and play!
